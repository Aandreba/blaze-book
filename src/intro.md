# Introduction
> **Note**\
> Blaze is still very much unstable and in early development. At this stage, methods and traits may be changed without deprecation period. Unexpected bugs may arise.

Blaze is a Rust crate that has the goal of **rustifying** and **simplyfying** as much as possible the OpenCL experience.

This goal is achieved with the introduction of various abstractions, most of them with syntax simillar to a Rust counterpart.
