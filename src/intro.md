# Introduction
>> **Note**\
>> Blaze ist still very much in early development. Unexpected bugs may arise.

Blaze is a Rust crate that has the goal of **rustifying** & **simplyfying** as much as possible the OpenCL experience.

This goal is achieved with the introduction of various abstractions, most of them with syntax simillar to a Rust counterpart.
