# Contributions

If you wish to contribute to the Blaze project, here are a couple of areas in which help would be much apreciated.
Don't shy away from contributing to the project in a way not mentioned here, this are mere examples.

## Documentation
One of the most important contributions would bo those to the documentation. Since this Blaze started as a solo-project, some (perhaps much) of it's documentation isn't up to
standard. Don't be afraid to make a pull request **on the dev branch** if you want to contribute to the documentation.
Also feel free to contact a maintainer, or any other contributor, if you have any questions.

## Bug fixes
Another major type of contribution is bug fixes. If you find a bug, please report it with a new issue on the [GitHub repository](todo).

## New features
The Blaze project is always excited about the prospect of addding new features and improving existsing ones. If you have any ideas for new features, please feel free to create a new issue on the [GitHub repository](todo).
